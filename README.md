upbase 0.1.0
======

This is a CSS helper library for the stuff we do pretty often. There are a number of helpers in here, all of which should conform to the following:

- Can be called from a separate stylesheet and not modified in place (ie, themed)
- Should be tested and compatible with all browsers OR have known and documented compatibility
- Will think of more guidelines. 

### If you want to use this from inside the components folder
Add this line to your `config.rb`:   
`add_import_path "./components/upbase/components"`
