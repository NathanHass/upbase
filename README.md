This is a CSS helper library for the stuff we do pretty often. There are a number of helpers in here, all of which should conform to the following:

- Can be called from a separate stylesheet and not modified in place (ie, themed)
- Should be tested and compatible with all browsers OR have known and documented compatibility
- Will think of more guidelines.
